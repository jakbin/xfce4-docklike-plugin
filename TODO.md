# TODO

+ Format code and change variable_style
+ Make separate light and dark themes?
+ Greyscale/pixelate minimized thumbnail images
+ Layering of XDG_DATA_DIRS is not working: files in /usr/share/applications, should not be used over those in home
+ Use X-Flatpak value for icon/desktop file names if it exists
+ Handle running out of dock space, overflow menu?
+ Make sure the label never overlaps the indicator
+ Use g_app_info_get_all() rather than finding apps ourselves?
+ Investigate Gtk-CRITICAL from DnD
+ Move aliases to a text file so users can add stuff
+ Test how well the updating thumbnails perform on a really slow system
+ Can we still crash the plugin?
